<h2>Rewards System</h2>
<p>
	The Campus Store Rewards program is our way of thanking you for being a loyal customer of our store. 
	Here's how it works. For every dollar you spend at the bookstore you'll earn one reward point. 
	Reward points are redeemable for Campus Store Rewards accounts that can used to purchase anything 
	in either the Alfred or Wellsville Campus Stores.</p>


<h2>Accumulating Points</h2>
<p>To make accumulating points easy, you can shop three ways:<br>
	&emsp;1. At our FSU Campus Stores<br>
	&emsp;2. On-line at https://www.bkstr.com/floridastatestore/home<br><br>
	Whenever you shop, make sure you tell the cashier or select the "loyalty" option online.<br><br>

	We'll even give you 10 Bonus Points just for signing up!</p>


<h2>Redeeming Points</h2>
<p>Students redeem Rewards points on-line to convert them to a Rewards account on your Campus Card. 
	Rewards accounts can be used only in FSU Campus Stores (let the cashier know that there is money 
	on the rewards account when you want to spend this money)<br><br>
	Rewards points are redeemed as follows on either a Campus Store Rewards account on your FSUID or on a Campus Store Rewards card:<br><br>
	&emsp;1. At 250 points you will receive $5.00 in Rewards<br>
	&emsp;2. At 500 points you will receive $15.00 in Rewards<br>
	&emsp;3. At 750 you will receive $25.00 in Rewards<br>
	&emsp;4. At 1000 points you will receive $40.00 in Rewards<br><br>
	Rewards points expire one year from date of earning. Rewards accounts and Rewards cards expire one year from date of activation. Points, accounts and cards are not redeemable for cash.</p>
